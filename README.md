Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
Objective:
This task demonstrates how to create a dictionary in Python and retrieve data based on user input.

How it works:

A dictionary named marks is initialized with student names as keys and their marks as values.

The user is prompted to enter a studentâ€™s name.

If the name exists in the dictionary, the program displays the corresponding marks.

If the name is not found, an appropriate message is shown.

Key Concepts:

Dictionary data structure (dict)

User input handling

Conditional statements for checking key existence

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
Objective:
This task shows how to perform basic list slicing and reversal operations in Python.

How it works:

A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created using range() and converted into a list.

The first five elements are extracted using list slicing (a[:5]).

The sliced list is reversed using the reverse() method.

Both the original sliced list and the reversed version are printed.

Key Concepts:

List creation with range()

List slicing

In-place list reversal using .reverse()
